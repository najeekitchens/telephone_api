# telephone_api
Create an application that parses the file ‘code_challenge_data_1.txt’ data and provides a RESTFul API to serve the data as if it were to be used by a web application. The web app could be used to search for phone numbers by country, region, local exchange etc so be cognizant of how you make the data accessible.
